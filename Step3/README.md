# Washington State University 2019 Smart Enviornments Undergraduate Research Program
This REU program is hosted by the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Washington State University. The program consists of 10 weeks working with top research professors and graduate students at WSU. I worked alongside [Doctor Haipeng Cai](https://chapering.github.io) and conducted research focused on multiple-language use of open-source software projects on Github. Our research including topics such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data mining.

## Research Questions
These are the fundamental questions driving our research and data collection efforts.

### RQ1: What are the Overall LanLanguagefuage Use Statistics
1.  How many languages by average are used by these sampled projects? 
2.  What is the distribution of the languages used across all these projects in Mentions?
3.  What is the distribution of the languages used across all these projects in Bytes?
4.  What are the top combinations of languages across all these projects?
5.  What is the average+stdev of each languageâ€™s percentage use across all the projects?

### RQ2: Relevant Semantics of Multiple-Language Use
1. What are the application/functionality domain of the projects? (e.g., accounting software, personal health apps, games, ML 2. Can we identify the potential correlation between these domains and the multiple-language use patterns?

### RQ3: Reasoning behind Multiple-Languages being used in Individual Projects
1. How are different kinds of components of a project are associated with the varied languages in the project?

### RQ4: Evolution of Multiple-Language Use
1. How have projects evloved, in multiple-language use, that have a reasonably long version history spanning multiple years?
